        Describe in detail the exact steps that someone else can take to
        reproduce this bug using the current stable release of NetBox and the plugin.
        Begin with the creation of any necessary database objects and call out every
        operation being performed explicitly. If reporting a bug in the REST API, be
        sure to reconstruct the raw HTTP request(s) being made: Don't rely on a client
        library such as pynetbox. Additionally, **do not rely on the demo instance**
        for reproducing suspected bugs, as its data is prone to modification or
        deletion at any time.
